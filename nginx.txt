sud ufw app list//Nginx registers itself as a service with ufw, our firewall, upon installation. This makes it rather easy to allow Nginx access.
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw enable //开启激动防火墙

sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw ufw delete allow 'Nginx HTTP'


Server Configuration

/etc/nginx: The nginx configuration directory. All of the Nginx configuration
files reside here.
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf: The main Nginx configuration file. This can be modified
to make changes to the Nginx global configuraiton.
/etc/nginx/sites-available: The directory where per-site "server blocks" can
be stored. Nginx will not use the configuration files found in this directory
unless they are linked to the sites-enabled directory (see below). Typically,
all server block configuration is done in this directory, and then enabled by
linking to the other directory.
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/: The directory where enabled per-site "server
blocks" are stored. Typically, these are created by linking to configuration
files found in the sites-available directory.
/etc/nginx/snippets: This directory contains configuration fragments that can
be included elsewhere in the Nginx configuration. Potentially repeatable
configuration segments are good candidates for refactoring into snippets.
Server Logs

/var/log/nginx/access.log: Every request to your web server is recorded in
this log file unless Nginx is configured to do otherwise.
/var/log/nginx/error.log: Any Nginx errors will be recorded in this log.
